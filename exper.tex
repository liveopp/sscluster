To demonstrate the practical implications of our robustness guarantees for LASSO-SSC, we conduct four numerical experiments including three with synthetic generated data and one with real data. For fast computation, we use ADMM implementation of LASSO solver
  with default numerical parameters. Its complexity is proportional to the problem size and the convergence guarantee \cite{boyd2011admm}. We also implement a simple ADMM solver for the matrix version SSC
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MatrixLasso}
\begin{aligned}
\min_{C} \; \|C\|_1+\frac{\lambda}{2}\|X-XC\|_F^2 \quad
\text{s.t.} \;\quad\mathrm{diag}(C)=0,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which is consistently faster than the column-by-column LASSO version. This algorithm is first described in \cite{elhamifar2012ssc_journal}. To be self-contained, we   provide the pseudocode and some numerical simulation in the appendix.
